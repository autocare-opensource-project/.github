This community-driven initiative is dedicated to **enhancing** developer skills, fostering collaboration, and showcasing innovative projects to a global audience. Our mission is to build a suite of interconnected tools and applications for a _fictional_ system about automotive care, leveraging modern technologies mainly around **Spring Framework**, **ReactJS**, and more.

Founded by [Firas Regaieg](https://github.com/firasrg), a fullstack developer with extensive experience in **JavaScript** and **Java** technologies. This organization aims to create good-quality, open-source projects that empower developers to learn, contribute, have fun and build a strong portfolio. We’re passionate about creating scalable projects, and fostering a welcoming community for people of all skill levels.

## Our Current Projects

Currently, there are 2 main repositories: a **REST API** and a **Web UI**. In the future, these projects will integrate as 2 services. We also have plans for additional subprojects, such as a documentation website, CI/CD pipeline and Bots.

### 1. AutoCare REST API
- **Repository**: [autocare-rest-api](https://github.com/autocare-opensource-project/autocare-rest-api)
- **Main Tech Stack**: Java, Jakarta EE, Maven, Tomcat, Spring Boot, REST, SQL and others.
- **Status**: In development.

### 2. AutoCare Web UI
- **Repository**: [autocare-webui](https://github.com/autocare-opensource-project/autocare-webui)
- **Main Tech Stack**: TypeScript, ReactJS, React Router, React Hook Form, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, Zod, and others
- **Status**: In development, using a mock API. Planned for integration with the AutoCare REST API in the future.

### Future Subprojects
We have an exciting roadmap to expand the AutoCare ecosystem:
- **Documentation Website**: A dedicated repository for a comprehensive documentation site to provide guides, API documentation, and tutorials.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A separate repository to manage CI/CD workflows, ensuring robust and automated development processes.
- **Own Libraries**: Additional libraries or utilities that can be used across the AutoCare ecosystem, such as authentication, data validation, or API clients.
- **Discord Bot**: A bot to enhance community engagement on our Discord server, offering features like project updates, service reminders, or API queries.
